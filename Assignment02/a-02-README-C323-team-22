Comparing our a01 to our a02:

We were able to accomplish our goals from assignment 01 and successfully already implement almost all 
outlined features completely. 

We were able to stay on the same page as a group and work both in team meetings and individually.

Our wireframes became true to form and our storyboard looks essentially identical.

The flow of events in our app also matches what we outlined in our UML diagrams.
