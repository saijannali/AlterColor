Our app will enable its users to edit photos from their camera rolls.

First they will choose their desired photo - they will be given the option to choose from their camera 
roll or take a new photo. If they choose to browse existing photos they will, the first time, need 
to give the app permission to view photos. If taking a new photo, they will have to allow the app
to access the camera.

They will then be able to edit the photos by adjusting the photo's hue and its brightness/ contrast. 
These can be adjusted by choosing one of the three buttons 'hue', 'brightness', or 'contrast'
Each will pop up a slider allowing the user to adjust the properties on a sliding scale.

Once satisfied with their photo they will be able to click the 'save' button.

The photo will then be saved to their camera roll and a pointer to the photo (in the camera roll) will 
be saved in a table view/ the app's persistent storage.

Our app will use UIImagePickerController and Accelerate.

----
The name of our app will be Alter Color or AlterColor.

The program we used to edit the UML sheets was Lucidchart.
